            <h3>Global Sentiment Analyser</h3>
            <p>Sentiment analysis is an automated process capable of understanding the feelings or opinions that underlie a text. It is one of the most interesting subfields of NLP, a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on how machines process human language.

                Sentiment analysis studies the subjective information in an expression, that is, the opinions, appraisals, emotions, or attitudes towards a topic, person or entity. Expressions can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. For example:
                
                “I really like the new design of your website!” → Positive
                “I’m not sure if I like the new design” → Neutral
                “The new design is awful!” → Negative</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Time table Generator</h3>
            <p>You will get a timetable generator that uses AI to create a timetable keeping all of your requirements in view. It will be able to generate as many timetables as you want.
                I will have your requirements hard coded so every time you want it to generate a timetable all of your requirements will be fulfilled.
                
                Requirements will not be changeable after the generator's development is done, but you can give as many requirements as you want.
                I will send you an example as well to show you what the require …
